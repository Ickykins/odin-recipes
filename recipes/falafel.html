            Description
        </h2>
        <p> 
            My falafel recipe is more than just a list of ingredients and how-to steps; 
            it’s a century-old legacy wrapped in the warmth of Middle Eastern hospitality 
            and the love of Lebanese tradition. This authentic falafel recipe has been passed 
            down through my family over several generations; it embodies the core of family 
            and the rich flavors that define my culture.

            <li>2 teaspoons coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

            Instructions
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the chickpeas with water in a medium bowl. Set aside at
             room temperature to soak for at least 12 or up to 24 hours. They will 
             end up doubling in size.

            <li>Drain the chickpeas. Rinse and dry them as thoroughly as possible 
                — I like to use a salad spinner for this.
                
            <li>Place the chickpeas and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to 
                fine, pebble-sized pieces. Add the parsley, cilantro, onion, garlic, cumin, 
                coriander, and black pepper. Blend until the mixture turns into a thick
                paste, scraping down the sides as needed. Remove the blade from the bowl, 
                then cover the bowl of the food processor and refrigerate for 1 hour (this lets 
                allows the batter to set).

            <li>Remove the falafel batter from the fridge. Sprinkle the baking powder over the 
                top, then gently fold it throughout.

            <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and another baking sheet with a double layer
             of paper towels. Set aside.

            <li>Using a medium spring-loaded cookie scoop (or your hands), scoop, firmly pack, and 
                roll about 1 ½ tablespoons of batter into a round ball and add it to the parchment-lined 
                baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining batter. Don’t worry if the balls feel a little 
                loose at first — they will bind once they fry.

            <li>Heat 1 inch of oil in a large, high-sided frying pan over medium heat. When a small 
                piece of batter dropped into the oil begins to sizzle, carefully add 10 to 12 of the 
                balls, being careful not to crowd the pan. Fry until golden-brown and crispy, 3 to 
                3 ½ minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked falafel to the 
                paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining uncooked falafel.

            <li>Transfer the falafel to a serving platter alongside the tahini sauce for dipping. Serve warm.
