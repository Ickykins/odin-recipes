            Instructions
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve honey, yeast, and olive oil in warm water and let
                 proof for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Add flour and salt in seperate bowl and mix. 
                Make a well in the flour and pour yeast mixture in.
            </li>
            <li>
                 Knead the dough about 7 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other container, cover it, 
                and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, whatever fits your schedule.
            </li>
            <li>
                ently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces, for 
                medium-crust pizza; or three pieces, for thicker crusts. Use a 
                rolling pin to roll each piece, on a lightly greased surface, into 
                a circle to fit a 12" pizza pan. Let the dough rest several times to 
                relax it and make it more cooperative. If you prefer a more artisan 
                look to your crust, with scattered random air pockets throughout, 
                hand-stretch the dough to size. Again, letting it rest periodically 
                makes the job easier., Place the rounds on pizza pans; on baking sheets; 
                or, if you have a pizza stone in your oven, on parchment., 
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 450°F.
            </li>
            <li>
                While it's heating, get out your toppings, which you've prepared 
                ahead. Some possibilities include sliced pepperoni; sautéed mushrooms, 
                onions, or peppers; cooked meats; olives; anchovies; and grated or 
                shredded cheese., Brush each crust with a bit of olive oil; spread pizza 
                or spaghetti sauce lightly over the surface, and let your guests add their 
                favorite toppings. Sprinkle the top with grated cheese., 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown, the 
                toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. Remove the pizzas 
                from the oven., Immediately transfer pizzas to a cooling rack, so their 
                bottoms don't get soggy. After about 10 minutes &lpar;to allow the toppings to set&rpar;, 
                slice and serve; a pair of scissors is a great cutting tool.
            </li>
        </ol>

            Optional cooking methods
        </h3>
        <ul>
            If making the  &ldquo;Viral leftover pizza sandwich&rdquo; devide dough into two
            for two large sandwiches or more for smaller sandwich sizes. Flour a surface and 
            roll dough out so it's about 1/4in. thick, oil the surface and sprinkle the outer
            inch with cornmeal &lpar;to allow you to open it more easily&rpar;. Fold in half 
            and cook in preheated oven for ~15 minutes or until parts of the surface are 
            golden brown.
        </ul>
